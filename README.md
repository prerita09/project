With increasing dependence on technology in all the domains, professionals are aiming for even higher pros of Machine Learning in particular by using it for the prediction and prognosis of Breast Cancer and not just its diagnosis. Breast Cancer prediction is different from its diagnosis and detection because in cancer prediction we work on three aspects: The risk of developing cancer, The reiteration of cancer, Surviving probability after cancer. It is a very difficult and risk-prone task to perform as further diagnosis and treatment depends on this prognosis and prediction. After the cleaning, processing and splitting of the dataset for training, testing and cross-validation, a random model will be built with maximum possible Multiclass so as to have a standard to compare ML prediction models with and decide which algorithm would be best to build the final Machine learning model for maximum precision. A categorical analysis on the columns given in the dataset will be done so as to know the impact and significance of each attribute on the final prediction. Data preprocessing is done to get it in the proper format for the application of the machine learning algorithms. The Machine Learning Classification techniques which have been used in the Project are K-nearest neighbours (K-NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes and Random Forest.
